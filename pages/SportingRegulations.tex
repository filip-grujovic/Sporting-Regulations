      \item 
    \end{enumerate}

    \section{Required roles during Flight}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item \textbf{PL: Pilot}\\The pilot is the person responsible for flying the UAV.
      \item \textbf{AO: Airspace Observer/Spotter}\\The AO stands next to the PL and has an unobstructed view of the airspace around the drone. They talk to the PL directly in person. The PL and AO are allowed to communicate via intercom if they stay right next to each other. 
      \item \textbf{FE: Safety Engineer}\\The safety engineer is the one who was responsible for the safety report. Their task is to constantly monitor the situation and warn the others if they are getting into any problematic situations. 
      \item \textbf{FOL: Flight Operations Lead}\\The FOL makes the tactical decisions during the flight. They request for Takeoff Permission from CL (Competition Lead). They manage contingency and emergency procedures. They are essentially the boss of the teams operation.
    \end{enumerate}

    \section{Optional roles during Flight}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item \textbf{FE: Flight Engineer}\\The Flight Engineer reads the data which is streamed down by the Aircraft in real time. They monitor battery temperatures, voltages, vibration sensors etc. and can give advise to the pilots.
      \item \textbf{AOGX: Additional Airspace Observers/Spotters}\\Not yet defined number of Airspace and Ground Observers according to the terrain and track layout.
      According to the terrain it might be useful to place additional oberservers on the field to have an external look at whether the air or ground situation changes. They can be equipped with radios and talk to FOL.
      \item \textbf{PCX: Pit Crew }\\The pit crew is there to make changes on the eVTOL which are permitted by the rules within the time limit. They also get the AC ready for the flight and make sure it is transported away afterward. Only they are allowed to touch the aircraft during the flights. 
    \end{enumerate}

    \section{Requirements for the pilots}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Each team must have at least three different designated pilots. The names of those pilots must be sent to the organizer at least 
      30 days before the competition. 
      \item Each pilot must have flown and documented at least twenty (20) hours on comparable UAVs (e.g. Racing Quadrocopters) in the past 12 months.  
      \item The pilots must be able to fluently communicate with the organizers in english, in order to be able to follow safety relevant commands during flight.
    \end{enumerate}


    \section{Parc Fermé}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Parc Fermé begins at the moment the Team starts the Thrust-Stand-Event for the first time during the competition days. It ends with the completion of all three competition flights. 
      \item While Parc Fermeé is active teams are not allowed to work on the UAVs. Only the following works are allowed to be carried out: 
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Balancing of propellers
        \item Cleaning of any parts of the aircraft
        \item Exchange of batteries
        \item Charging of batteries 
        \item Reading logs and taking measurements
        \item Tightening of any loose screws
        \item Repair of accident damage as long as the crash is deemed by the organizer to not have happened on purpose. 
      \end{itemize}
      \item Work on safety related systems may be done after submitting a written request to the organizer and getting it accepted by the organizer. 
    \end{enumerate}

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item 
    \end{enumerate}

    \section{Start of a Session}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Each team gets a certain time slot during which they are allowed to takeoff. They choose the timing of their takeoff during this time on their own. If they do not start within this time limit a DNS (Did not start) is called and the run invalid and will not be retaken. This is comparable to the process ski jumpers undergo during their competitions. 
    \end{enumerate}

    \section{Suspension of a Session}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item 
    \end{enumerate}

      \item 
    \end{enumerate}

    \section{Comparability between runs}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item To ensure comparability between the runs, the organizers are going to set limits on the metrological conditions during which the runs can happen. If the organizer is calling the conditions to be fine for takeoff the takeoff time window rule applies. \\
      The organizers will monitor the following conditions at the track during the flights:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Precipitation
        \item Temperature 
        \item Windspeed
        \item Humidity
        \item Air Pressure
        \item GNSS Connectivity and satellite number at fixed position on site (GPS only) 
        \item Frequency jamming
      \end{itemize}

    \end{enumerate}

    \section{Disciplines}
    \subsection{Hotlap races}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item There will be a total of three (3) hotlap races on different tracks during the competition. 
      \item Each team will be given a fivteen (15) minute time window during which they can conduct their flights. 
      \item Each team is only allowed to fly a maximum of three timed (3) laps during their time window. 
      \item Each laptime will be logged by the organizer. It counts as the time from which the start lights turn off until the aircraft has crossed the timing/finish line. 
      \item Teams can earn up to 25 Points during the competition. The exact point distribution is subject to change and will be affected by many factors such as the number of participants.
      The teams will be notified as soon as there is more information available.
      \item The points will be awarded in order of fastest hotlaps achieved by the teams during their time window.
      \item If two or more competitors achieve the exact same finish time, their points will be added together and divided equally across the them.  
    \end{itemize}
